# SmartScanQr 
Smart QR-code scanner is a personal project, an application that uses a neural network to detect QR codes on images of grocery receipts. The application processes the image of a receipt and uses the neural network to locate the QR code on the image, it then automatically cuts out the QR code from the image and aligns it regardless of the angle at which the receipt was positioned when the image was taken. This project aims to automate the process of extracting QR codes from images of receipts, making it faster and more accurate. It allows users to quickly and easily scan QR codes without the need for manual cropping or alignment.
